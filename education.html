              <h2>Why  education is important?</h2>
          <p>
              It helps people become better citizens, get a better-paid job,
             shows the difference between good and bad. Education shows us 
             the importance of hard work and, at the same time, helps us grow 
             and develop. Thus, we are able to shape a better society to live 
             in by knowing and respecting rights, laws, and regulations.

             Having education in an area helps people think, 
             feel, and behave in a way that contributes to their
             success, and improves not only their personal                               
             satisfaction but also their community. In addition,
             education develops human personality, thoughts,
             dealing with others and prepares people for life experiences.

            <h2>Education is especially important for poors!!!</h2>
            <p>
                Like a tree, poverty has many roots.
                But among the many causes of global poverty, 
                one factor stands out: education. Not every 
                person without an education is living in extreme poverty.
                But most of those living in extreme poverty do lack
                a basic education. Those living below the poverty 
                line will also be more likely to keep their children 
                out of school, which means that their children will 
                also have a greater chance of living in poverty. 
                Education is often referred to as the great equalizer:
                It can open the door to jobs, resources, and skills 
                that a family needs to not just survive, but thrive. 
                Access to high-quality primary education and supporting 
                child well-being is a globally-recognized solution to the
                cycle of poverty. This is, in part, because it also 
                addresses many of the other issues can keep communities 
                vulnerable. Let’s look at 3 ways education is the 
                secret ingredient to ending extreme poverty.

            <h2>THE IMPACT OF EDUCATION ON POVERTY: FACTS</h2>
            <p>
                Education directly correlates with many solutions to poverty, including: 
                <ul><strong>
               	<li>Economic growth</li>
               	<li>Reduced income inequality</li>
               	<li>Reduced infant and maternal deaths</li>
               	<li>Reduced stunting</li>
               	<li>Reduced vulnerability to HIV and AIDS</li>
               	<li>Reduced violence at home and in society</li>
                   
               According to UNESCO, if all students in low-income 
               countries had just basic reading skills (nothing else), 
               an estimated 171 million people could escape extreme poverty. 
               If all adults completed secondary education, we could cut 
               the global poverty rate by more than half.
                    </strong>
               </ul>
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Education can be the catalyst needed to   
                pull families and communities out of the  
                cycle of poverty. Knowledge gives children
                the power to dream of a better future and 
                the  confidence needed to pursue a full education,
                which in turn will help generations to come.Ipsum.
